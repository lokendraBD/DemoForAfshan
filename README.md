# WeatherDemo

This program is developed as a solution to assessment test provided by Afshan Alurkar and is intended for the specified recruiter only. Please do not access this code if it's not meant for you.

## Before using WeatherDemo, Which resources do you need?

- One of the latest iPhones or Xcode with appropriate simulator with iOS version 11.0+.
- MacOS with Xcode 9.4+ installed on it.

## How to run/test the program?

Download or clone the zip from the git url of this program, and run on Xcode. You might want to change the Development Team in the Project's Target General Settings.

Please enable internet connection on your device/simulator before you run it.

## If I had more time, I would implement

- A reachability class that would detect the internet connectivity.
- Alert messages if internet connection wasn't there.
- A drop-down to select a city from multiple options.
- More weather options.
- Add units (Celcius/Kelvin etc.) to the weather data
- A proper UI.
- Good app icon.
- Good splash screen.
- A progress view or hud-view while the API is being called in background.
- Would have documented and organized the code properly.
- Lot more.
